rfo-basic-launcher readme
=========================

Usage:
------

If you chose to install the Notepad++ shortcut, hit Shift+F5 when editing
your .bas program in Notepad++ and it will be sent to your Android device.

If you use another editor, you can register a shortcut to launch 
"Z:\RFO-BASIC!\!BASIC Launcher\client (PC)\rfo-basic-launcher.exe"
followed by the editor code for the current file being edited.
Read your editor help in order to write the proper command line.

In any other case, you can drag and drop your .bas on this executable
or its desktop shortcut to have it transfered to your Android device.

1. WiFi mode: (recommended)
-------------

- Make sure that you have RFO BASIC! installed on your Android device:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rfo.Basic

- Install the BASIC! Launcher (WiFi) app on your Android device:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rfo.BASICLauncher

- Computer and Android device need to be on the same LAN so they
  can autodetect each other (typically connected to the same box)

2. USB-debugging mode:
----------------------

It is also possible to transfer the file by cable between your computer
and the Android device. For this, you need to enable the USB-debugging
option on your device and have the device correctly detected by your
computer. This mode is harder to set up and we do not recommend it.
